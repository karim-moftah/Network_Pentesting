### AD Enumeration

Once we have that first set of AD credentials and the means to authenticate with them on the network, a whole new world of possibilities opens up! We can start enumerating various details about the AD setup and structure with authenticated access, even super low-privileged access.

During a red team engagement, this will usually lead to us being able to perform some form of privilege escalation or lateral movement to gain additional access until we have sufficient privileges to execute and reach our goals. In most cases, enumeration and exploitation are heavily entwined. Once an attack path shown by the enumeration phase has been exploited, enumeration is again performed from this new privileged position, as shown in the diagram below.

ssh za.tryhackme.com\\<AD Username>@thmjmp1.za.tryhackme.com

When prompted, provide your account's associated password. Although RDP can be used for all tasks, SSH is faster and can be used for Task 4, 5, and 6.
